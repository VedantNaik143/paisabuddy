## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

As a new generation of young Indians steps into the workforce, there is a significant gap in their practical financial literacy. Traditional education systems often overlook real-world financial skills, leaving many young adults unfamiliar with concepts like investments, credit management, and digital fraud prevention. This knowledge gap hinders their ability to build wealth, make informed financial decisions, and protect themselves from financial risks.
